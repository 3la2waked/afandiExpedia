A servlet and JSP based Java web application.
I have an overall of 5 years of Java experience. Java  was designed to allow developers to get their job done with the minimum of fuss,
it is also a rock-solid platform that performs on a level that can match or even exceed that of native code.

In this assignment, I got a remarkable idea about handling JSON objects and arrays, and how to display them. I would also like to highlight the tiny experience I had about the jUnit test cases, since this is the first time I'm dealing with such thing.
